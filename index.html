      <h2 class="centered">About Us</h2>
      <p class="type-big">Reign of Iron is a clan playing Destiny 2 on PC. We primarily focus on PvP gameplay, but also spend a fair amount of time on PvE endgame content, like raids and prestige Nightfalls.</p>

      <h2 class="centered gold">Why Reign of Iron?</h2>
      <p class="white">Reign of Iron is a mid-sized clan with a healthy active roster full of people who <em>still enjoy this game</em>. Our goal is to make friends and help others enjoy this game too. Our main focus is PvP and ultimately consistent success in Trials, as well as building a Prestige Raid team.</p>
      <p class="white">Our members are strong players, but we're not gods. That means that you don't have to be a god to join (but if you are, <em>awesome</em>), and that we are not a carry clan.</p>
      <p class="white">No K/D requirements. No required hours of operation. Just know what you're doing out there, be willing to make callouts and play as a team, and strive to improve every week. That's what we're doing too.</p>
