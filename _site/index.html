      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="type-big">Reign of Iron is a clan playing Destiny 2 on PC. We primarily focus on PvP gameplay, but also spend a fair amount of time on PvE endgame content, like raids and prestige Nightfalls.</p>

      <h2 class="centered gold">Why Reign of Iron?</h2>
      <p class="white">Reign of Iron is a mid-sized clan with a healthy active roster full of people who <em>still enjoy this game</em>. Our goal is to make friends and help others enjoy this game too. Our main focus is PvP and ultimately consistent success in Trials, as well as building a Prestige Raid team.</p>
      <p class="white">Our members are strong players, but we're not gods. That means that you don't have to be a god to join (but if you are, <em>awesome</em>), but we are not a carry clan.</p>
      <p class="white">No K/D requirements. No required hours of operation. Our only requirement is that you have Discord and use it. Just know what you're doing out there, be willing to make callouts and play as a team, and strive to improve every week. That's what we're doing too.</p>

        <h3 class="collapsible-title">Any clan rules?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <p>We don't police what our members do or say, and we'd like to keep it that way. So don't be a jerk to other members, and we won't need to make a bunch of rules to keep people in line.</p>

        <h3 class="collapsible-title">Where is the clan located?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <p>Reign of Iron is a primarily North American clan. We're not opposed to EU members, but you might have a harder time scheduling  with other members.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="collapsible-section">
        <h3 class="collapsible-title">What are the clan ranks? What's the Iron Brigade?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <p>Currently, there are five ranks in Reign of Iron: <strong>Iron Initiate</strong>, <strong>Iron Sentry</strong>, <strong>Iron Brigadier</strong>, <strong>Brigadier General</strong>, and <strong>Iron Lord</strong>.</p>
          <h4>Iron Initiate <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #eee; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>Iron Initiate is a trial-level rank that applies for the first week of membership, restricting some of your permissions in Discord. Barring anything out of the ordinary, Iron Initiates become Iron Sentries after one week.</p>
          <p>Former members and Reign of Iron Friends & Family are given the option to remain as Iron Initiates in the clan Discord.</p>
          <h4>Iron Sentry <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #72c173; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>Iron Sentry is the entry level clan rank. Sentries are active members who are here to hang out, have fun, make friends, and work on getting better and eventually become Iron Brigadiers.</p>
          <h4>Iron Brigadier <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #6cbdd1; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>The Iron Brigade is the elite rank of guardians in Reign of Iron. They have put in the time to rise above the rest in PvP, raids, Nightfalls, etc. Though promotions are handled on a case-by-case basis, Brigadiers generally have a >1.0 base K/D, several raid completions, and act as mentors to Iron Sentries.</p>
          <h4>Brigadier General <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #a95fb5; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>Brigadier Generals are leadership in Reign of Iron. Brigadier Generals are highly accomplished players and distinguished leaders who work directly with the Iron Lord to help manage the clan and improve membership experience overall.</p>
          <h4>Iron Lord <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #dac057; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>The Iron Lord is a lone rank reserved for the clan founder, <strong>CanisMajoris</strong>. The Iron Lord makes all final decisions related to the clan, plain and simple.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="collapsible-section">
        <h3 class="collapsible-title">Can I hang out and play with RoI even if I'm not in the clan?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <p>If we play against you frequently, and you hold your own against us, we'll probably hit you with a friend request and a clan invite. If you're not looking to join the clan, you can still be <strong>RoI Friends & Family</strong> and hang out in our Discord, but you'll maintain an Iron Initiate rank unless you decide to join in full.</p>
          <p>Members who decide leave Reign of Iron (on good terms) will be allowed to remain in the Discord as Iron Initiates.</p>
